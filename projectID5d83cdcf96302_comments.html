<HTML><BODY>In the series of works translated from Dutch, this 1892 naturalistic novel by Louis Couperus cannot be excluded. The <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19563">Dutch original</a> has been in PG for many years. Some background of this debut novel can be found at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eline_Vere">Wikipedia</a>, and a long review (of another, modern, translation) appeared in the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/books/book-review-eline-vere-1-475466">Scotsman</a> almost 10 years ago. This translation appears to be slightly abbreviated.

<p>The scan sources are <a href="https://archive.org/details/elinevere00coup/page/n6">here</a>.

</p><p>I do not foresee many difficulties, so have fun!
